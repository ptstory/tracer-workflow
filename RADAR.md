## mitsuhiko/gh-issue-sync — 2026-08-27
- Source: direct link
- Claims: syncs GitHub issues to local markdown for offline batch editing.
- Verdict: skip
- Reason: batch refinement is its value and issue authoring runs in ChatGPT web, which has no filesystem access; on push it silently creates missing labels, which would worsen existing label-vocabulary drift; comments are write-only so the comment-based verdict contract state is not mirrored; does not touch PRs.
- Taken: nothing yet — the parent/blocked_by/blocks front matter plus temp-ID reference rewriting is the one piece worth revisiting if issue authoring ever moves onto a local seat.

## LilMGenius/paperthin — 2026-08-27
- Source: direct link
- Claims: 28 low-level agentic design-pattern skills, agent-agnostic, auto-updating install.
- Verdict: take-the-idea
- Reason: the nba skill duplicates the unformalized project-cockpit pattern; its state reader is bound to paperthin's own re0-plan/re0-loop cycle folders, so only its rules transfer; global auto-updating symlinked skills repeat the unpinned-plugin failure mode that cost the Jun-Aug measurement window; hate/shower/catchup/re0-memo overlap review-gate, $handoff and the instincts layer.
- Taken: nba's contract — one action not a menu, cite the state read, name the avoided move, observable done-when — to be ported against gh state.

## herdr — 2026-07-31 seen, 2026-08-27 trialing
- Source: friend running Ghostty + herdr
- Claims: agent-aware terminal runtime; persistent background server, per-pane working/blocked/idle state, ssh reattach, agent-drivable CLI.
- Verdict: undecided, in trial
- Reason: pane state duplicates what ocs was reframed around, at the multiplexer layer instead of AppleScript plus a plugin JSONL; ssh reattach addresses the standing want to steer a blocked agent from a phone. Open question: whether a session running the goal plugin, which auto-continues on idle, ever registers as blocked.
- Taken: pending trial outcome. If pane state works, ocs PR #1 and branch feat/initial-cli get closed.
